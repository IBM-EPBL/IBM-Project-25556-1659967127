<h1>PARKINSON'S DISEASE</h1>
<p>Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves. 
    Parkinson's disease does not directly cause people to die, but the condition can place great strain on the body, and can make some
     people more vulnerable to serious and life-threatening infections. But with advances in treatment, most people with Parkinson's disease
      now have a normal or near-normal life expectancy. One clear risk is age: Although most people with Parkinson's first develop the 
      disease after age 60, about 5% to 10% experience onset before the age of 50. Early-onset forms of Parkinson's are often, but not
       always, inherited, and some forms have been linked to specific gene mutations.</p>

<h3 style="padding-top:20px ;">TREATMENT:</h3>
<p style="margin-top:20px ;">There is no one-size-fits all treatment for Parkinson’s. Rather, treatment should be tailored to an individual’s 
    symptoms via a shared decision-making process with your healthcare provider.
    Treatment may include things that you do yourself, such as exercise, or things that you do with oversight, such as physical therapy,
     occupational therapy, and speech therapy or talk therapy. It may also include medications specific to your needs, such as medications 
     aimed at improving your movement, and others aimed at improving non-movement symptoms such as constipation, urinary dysfunction, or sleep. 
     The treatment of Parkinson’s is often best served via a team approach, with you – the person with PD – at the center and incorporation of 
     your care partner, healthcare provider, therapists and other healthcare providers who treat specific symptoms of Parkinson’s.</p>

    <h4>Exercise:</h4>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;font-size:larger;margin-left:100px">Exercise can improve many PD symptoms. It is a vital to maintaining balance, mobility, mental health and activities of daily living for people with Parkinson’s</p>

    <h4>Prescription Medications:</h4>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;font-size:larger;margin-left:100px">The choice of medication treatment depends on many variables, including symptoms present. Learn more about the types of available medications.</p>

    <h4>Surgical Treatment Options:</h4>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;font-size:larger;margin-left:100px">Looking to explore advanced treatment options? Surgery can be an effective option for managing and improving many movement PD symptoms.</p>

    
    <h4>Levodopa:</h4>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;font-size:larger;margin-left:100px;">Most people with Parkinson's disease eventually need a medication called levodopa.
        Levodopa is absorbed by the nerve cells in your brain and turned into the chemical dopamine, which is used to transmit messages between the parts of the brain and nerves that control movement.
        Increasing the levels of dopamine using levodopa usually improves movement problems.
        It's usually taken as a tablet or liquid, and is often combined with other medication, such as benserazide or carbidopa.
        These medications stop the levodopa being broken down in the bloodstream before it has a chance to get to the brain.</p>
